Subject: Request for Team Change Due to Ongoing Conflicts and Unfair Treatment

Dear [HR Manager's Name or Supervisor's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to formally raise concerns regarding my current work environment and ongoing conflicts with my manager. Since joining this team, I have consistently encountered challenges in communication and collaboration with my reporting manager, which have affected both my morale and productivity.

Although I was initially hired as a Java Developer, I have been assigned primarily to testing tasks over the past three years. Recently, I was asked to resume coding, including Angular development, which I’ve not worked on in the past 3–4 years. I accepted the challenge and have been putting in my best efforts to deliver quality work. However, I feel that my efforts are being unfairly criticized regardless of the outcome.

Here are some specific concerns:

I am often blamed for issues that are not directly under my control, including production incidents and requirements ambiguity.

Despite following written requirements precisely, I’m frequently questioned or blamed for implementation details that were clearly specified in the documentation.

Work assignments are not well-scoped. For instance, tasks marked as 3-point stories end up requiring changes in numerous backend files, frontend files, and stored procedures — with unrealistic deadlines.

I experience discouraging treatment, including being spoken to disrespectfully and being treated as if I’m less competent than my peers, without any encouragement or recognition of my efforts.

There appears to be a lack of proper testing processes. Even after passing UAT, issues are later blamed solely on me instead of reviewing the testing process as a whole.

This constant pressure and lack of support have created a very stressful working environment for me. I would sincerely appreciate your intervention to either facilitate a discussion to improve the situation or to consider moving me to a different team where I can perform to the best of my abilities in a healthier and more respectful environment.

Thank you for taking the time to review this. I remain committed to my work and the organization, and I’m hopeful for a resolution that supports mutual growth.

Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]
